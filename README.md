# Final-Year-Project
PlayIt is a web-based system that is predominantly intended for people with a wide range of audiences over the internet. These people can be Distant Learning Teachers, Motivational or Political Speakers, Online Operating Stores, Applications conducting online surveys and many more. It has been observed that all these people face numerous issues regarding communication with the audience. The proposed system will be a centralized platform/portal where all of the above-mentioned users can conduct their live sessions for teaching or meetups etc. The audience for the session will be selected by the user. i.e. public or restricted based on filters as set by the user. The proposed system will aid in communication as it will provide a facility to take questions or feedback during live sessions. The questions and feedback will then be classified using text mining algorithms and the questions/comments that will be most important i.e. frequently asked by the users will be generated and shown to the users. The system will provide the facility if the user wants to conduct the sessions outside our platform i.e. on Facebook or YouTube etc. If he/she wants us to manage his/her questions or feedback then he/she can simply provide us a link to that session and the system will be able to read the comments and perform an operation on the comments and generate data accordingly.
